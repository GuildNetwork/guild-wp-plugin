Increase engagement on your site using [Guild](https://guild.network) widgets on your page.  We increase pageviews per visit.

== Description ==

Guild is a cloud service that helps you increase engagement on your site, leading to more revenue.

As a cloud service, we create and maintain a full index of all of the content on your site.  We combine that with analytics and viewing behavior patterns.

This plugin registers widgets that you can place anywhere on your pages that help visitors discover content on your site.  These widgets provide visitors with a simple interactive way to see all of the content available on your site in a highly engaging way.  We use contextual information to maximize the liklihood that a visitor will see another page that will interest them.
